<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A cheeseburger is a hamburger topped with cheese. Traditionally, the slice of cheese is placed on top of the meat patty. The cheese is usually added to the hamburger patty near the end of the cooking time, which allows the cheese to melt.
 Cheeseburgers can include variations in structure, ingredients and composition.</p>
